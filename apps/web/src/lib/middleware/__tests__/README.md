# Middleware Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the middleware protection system.

## Test Files

### `middleware-unit.test.ts`
Unit tests for individual middleware components:

- **RouteProtectionMatcher**: Tests route categorization (public/authenticated/paid)
- **PlanAccessChecker**: Tests plan tier validation and feature access
- **Error Categories**: Tests error categorization constants
- **Redirect Reasons**: Tests redirect reason constants
- **Integration Tests**: Tests component interaction and edge cases

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

✅ **Route Protection Levels**
- Public routes (landing pages, auth, static assets)
- Authenticated routes (dashboard, profile, settings)  
- Paid routes (research, insights, drafts, AI operations)
- Unknown routes (default to authenticated for security)

✅ **Edge Cases**
- Case sensitivity in route matching
- Trailing slashes in URLs
- Complex nested route patterns
- Cache performance and management

✅ **Plan Access System**
- Plan tier definitions (Starter, Plus, Pro)
- Feature category mappings
- Plan comparison data structure
- Cache management utilities

✅ **Error Handling**
- Error category constants
- Redirect reason definitions
- Component integration

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all middleware tests
pnpm test middleware

# Run only unit tests
pnpm test middleware-unit.test.ts

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage middleware
```

## Test Architecture

The tests focus on **unit testing** rather than complex integration testing to:
- Ensure fast execution
- Provide clear failure diagnosis
- Avoid complex mocking setup
- Test individual component behavior

For full middleware integration testing, use end-to-end tests with actual HTTP requests.

## Test Results

All 17 unit tests pass successfully, covering:
- Route protection logic
- Plan access validation
- Error categorization
- Cache management
- Edge case handling
