# Rule: Generating a Product Roadmap Document (RMD)

## Goal  
To guide an AI assistant in creating a clear, actionable Product Roadmap Document (RMD) in Markdown format, synthesising inputs from existing product, system, design, and feature specifications. The roadmap should map work items by implementation area (Backend / Frontend / Design / Infrastructure) and business timeline (Now / Next / Later) so that teams can plan, sequence, and communicate delivery.

## Process  
1. **Gather Inputs:** The user provides validated artefacts such as the Product Specification Document (PSD), System Specification Document (SSD), Feature Specification Documents (FSDs), and relevant design assets.  
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before writing the RMD, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to capture priorities, resource assumptions, and timeline definitions.  
3. **Generate RMD:** Using the inputs and answers to the clarifying questions, generate a roadmap with the structure outlined below.  
4. **Save RMD:** Save the document as `roadmap-[product-name].md` inside the `/specs` directory.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)  
The AI should adapt its questions based on context, but here are common areas to explore:

* **Business Phases:** "How do you define *Now*, *Next*, and *Later* for this product?"  
* **Priority Drivers:** "Which features or modules are most critical for the MVP?"  
* **Resource Allocation:** "How many developers, designers, and DevOps engineers are available per phase?"  
* **Time-boxing:** "What is the expected duration for each timeline phase (e.g., weeks 1-6)?"  
* **Dependencies:** "Are there hard dependencies (e.g., backend before frontend) we must respect?"  
* **Risk & Complexity:** "Which items carry the highest uncertainty or technical risk?"  
* **Success Metrics:** "What metrics will indicate that each phase is complete and successful?"  
* **Budget / Constraints:** "Are there budget ceilings or external deadlines that influence sequencing?"  

## RMD Structure  

1. **Timeline Overview**  
   - Define what *Now*, *Next*, and *Later* mean in business terms and weeks.  

2. **Feature Lists by Area and Phase**  
   - **Backend / Frontend / Design / Infrastructure** sections under each timeline bucket.  
   - Each item should include a short description, rough effort estimate, and noted dependencies.  

3. **Dependencies & Sequencing**  
   - Identify the critical path, blocking items, and work that can proceed in parallel.  

4. **Resource Planning**  
   - High-level team allocation, skill requirements, and any notable staffing constraints.  

5. **Success Metrics**  
   - Define measurable outcomes that signal completion of *Now*, *Next*, and *Later* phases.  

## Target Audience  
Assume the primary reader of the RMD is a **product manager, tech lead, or delivery manager**. The roadmap must be concise, prioritised, and easy to translate into sprint or project plans.

## Output  
* **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)  
* **Location:** `/specs/`  
* **Filename:** `roadmap-[product-name].md`

## Final Instructions  
1. Do NOT start generating the RMD immediately.  
2. Ask clarifying questions to confirm priorities, resources, and timeline definitions.  
3. Use single-line prompt style for all questions, mirroring the examples above.  
4. Populate the roadmap with concrete, estimated items and clear dependencies once answers are received.  
5. Ensure *Now* items deliver the core value proposition, *Next* items drive traction and retention, and *Later* items support scale and differentiation.
